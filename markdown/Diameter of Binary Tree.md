# [543. Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/description/)

Given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree, return the length of the **diameter**  of the tree.

The **diameter**  of a binary tree is the **length**  of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the <code>root</code>.

The **length**  of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/diamtree.jpg" style="width: 292px; height: 302px;">

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 10^4]</code>.
- <code>-100 <= Node.val <= 100</code>

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        res = 0

        def dfs(node: Optional[TreeNode]):
            if not node:
                return 0
            nonlocal res
            left = dfs(node.left)
            right = dfs(node.right)
            res = max(res, left + right)
            return 1 + max(left, right)

        dfs(root)
        return res
```
