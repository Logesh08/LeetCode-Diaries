# [297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/description/)

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:**  The input/output format is the same as <a href="https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/32442719377939-How-to-create-test-cases-on-LeetCode#h_01J5EGREAW3NAEJ14XC07GRW1A" target="_blank">how LeetCode serializes a binary tree</a>. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/serdeser.jpg" style="width: 442px; height: 324px;">

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[0, 10^4]</code>.
- <code>-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000</code>

## Solution

```python
class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.
        
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        res = []

        def dfs(node: TreeNode):
            if not node:
                res.append("N")
                return
            
            res.append(str(node.val))
            dfs(node.left)
            dfs(node.right)

        dfs(root)
        return ",".join(res)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.
        
        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        vals = data.split(",")
        self.index = 0

        def dfs():
            if vals[self.index] == "N":
                self.index += 1
                return None
            node = TreeNode(int(vals[self.index]))
            self.index += 1
            node.left = dfs()
            node.right = dfs()
            return node

        return dfs()
```
