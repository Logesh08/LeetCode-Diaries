# [994. Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/description/)

You are given an <code>m x n</code> <code>grid</code> where each cell can have one of three values:

- <code>0</code> representing an empty cell,
- <code>1</code> representing a fresh orange, or
- <code>2</code> representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent**  to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return <code>-1</code>.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/16/oranges.png" style="width: 650px; height: 137px;">

```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>m == grid.length</code>
- <code>n == grid[i].length</code>
- <code>1 <= m, n <= 10</code>
- <code>grid[i][j]</code> is <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>2</code>.
